    <h1>Syllabus</h1>
</div>

<div class="section">

<p>This is a full on studio class. While there will be lectures from me or
guests (inculding <strong>Warren Spector</strong>!) and/or class activities
from time to time the majority of the class time will be spent with you working
in project teams.</p>

<p>Additionally, due to a heavy conference schedule this semester I will
be out of town on March 6th, 18th, 20th and April 10th, 15th and possibly
the 17th.  Ways that these classes will be covered will likely include a
variety of techniques including other faculty sitting in, on-line sessions
with me from the conferences, your attendence at other campus events.
These are still in the works and you'll be kept up to date on these
alternatives via the my courses calendar so be sure to check it early and
often.</p>

<p>As you'll be in different teams working on different projects, dates
for presentations, reports, etc may vary team to team.  Good old mycourses
calendar again.  </p>
